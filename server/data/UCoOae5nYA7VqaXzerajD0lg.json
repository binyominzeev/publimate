I used to get hit with writer’s block constantly. Now, I’m VoicePalling my ideas: I grab my phone, go for a walk, and let VoicePal capture my thoughts while I get my steps in.\n\nThere’s something about being outdoors that just makes ideas flow easier. Walking, breathing fresh air, taking in the surroundings—it’s not about ‘writing’ anymore, but just talking through my ideas. Then VoicePal turns it all into a first draft that actually sounds like me.\n\nIf you’re ready to try a new way of ‘writing’ that feels more like a walk in the park (literally), search VoicePal on the App Store or Play Store :)\nhttps://bit.ly/Voicepal-YT-27-10-2024",

    "description": "Staring at a blank screen just wasn’t working, and being stuck at my desk all day killed my motivation. \n\nThat’s why my team and I created VoicePal: to make writing more fun and less of a grind. Now, I just talk through my ideas while walking, and the app turns them into a draft.\n\nI wish I had it when I wrote the book, it would've made things quicker and more enjoyable. Now I use it for my newsletter, LifeNotes, and brainstorming video ideas. It’s been a real game-changer.\n\nIf you want to check it out, just search VoicePal on the App Store :)",

We'll also discuss why studying effectively and efficiently is one of the best ways to maintain a work-life balance. \n\nWe'll break down (1) how to understand our content using techniques like the Feynman Method, Active Recall and various note-taking strategies, (2) how to remember our material with Spaced Repetition, Interleaving and various memory techniques, and (3) how to maintain focus while studying, from developing the motivation and discipline to do the work, to taking appropriate breaks and maintaining a healthy work-life balance. \n\n🔗 LINKS MENTIONED IN THIS VIDEO\n- 📑 Get My Ultimate Studying Bundle here! https://play.aliabdaal.com/studying-bundle?utm_campaign=The%20Ultimate%20Studying%20Bundle&utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_term=Long&utm_content=How%20to%20Study%20for%20Exams%20%283%20Hour%20Video%29\n- Check out my Flashcard Masterclass with Anki here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zaKVFC9Eu4\n\n📑 STUDIES CITED:\nImproving Students’ Learning With Effective Learning Techniques: https://www.skillshare.com/en/classes/How-to-Study-for-Exams-An-Evidence-Based-Masterclass/728748026/projects\nEffectiveness of highlighting for retention of text material (Fowler & Barker 1974): https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1974-33185-001\nType of Highlighted Material and Examination Performance (Leicht & Cashen 2014): https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220671.1972.10884329?needAccess=true&instName=University+of+Cambridge&journalCode=vjer20&\nBetter Mood and Better Performance: Learning Rule-Described Categories Is Enhanced by Positive Mood (Nadler et al 2010): https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610387441\n\n⌚️TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 - Introduction\n01:53 - 3 Steps to Effective Studying\n04:46 - Understand Anything with The Feynman Technique \n06:40 - The Science of Active Recall\n08:44 - How to Learn New Content with Active Recall\n10:25 - Taking Notes During Class\n12:45 - Taking Notes After Class\n17:40 - Scoping The Subject\n20:16 - The Importance of Understanding\n26:11 - Finding a Syllabus For Yourself\n31:06 - The Magic of Spaced Repetition\n35:11 - The Retrospective Revision Timetable\n37:07 - The Spaced Repetition Journal\n40:53 - The Power of Interleaved Practice\n43:10 - Should You Reread Your Notes\n45:10 - How to Highlight Effectively\n46:50 - How to Use Flashcards Properly\n56:15 - Flashcard Alternative - Google Sheets vs Anki\n01:08:42 - Mind Maps\n01:13:18 - Memory Techniques - Mnemonics\n01:18:18 - Memory Techniques - The Peg System\n01:23:50 - Memory Techniques - The Mind Palace\n01:26:07 - The Essay Memorisation Framework\n01:41:10 - The Active Recall Framework\n01:58:10 - How to Use Anki Flashcards Properly\n02:24:30 - Motivation is a Myth\n02:31:44 - How to Reduce Distractions\n02:35:32 - The Pomodoro technique - Pros and Cons\n02:40:37 - The Best Music to Study With\n02:42:54 - Maintaining Work Life Balance while Studying\n02:46:28 - How to Study Effectively with Friends\n02:48:35 - Conclusion",

Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account and please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty.\n\nPS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it goes into a company account which I then pay 21 team members, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions etc. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this \"top line business revenue\" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :) \n\n⌚️ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Intro\n01:54 Twitch\n02:54 Working as a doctor\n03:22 Mentor for BASB\n03:47 Real-estate\n04:43 Nebula\n05:11 Podcast sponsorships\n06:40 Stocks and shares\n10:20 Book deal\n12:00 Crypto\n15:15 Affiliate income\n17:37 YouTube AdSense\n19:56 Sponsorships\n22:46 Skillshare\n26:08 PTYA",

Please do take the trigger warning at the start into account. And please also understand that this is not an overnight success story, and there's no (legit) way to make money online without large amounts of work, luck and unfair advantages, of which I've had plenty. \n\nPS: This is all pre-tax revenue, and it all goes into a company account. Then I pay salaries for 2.5 full time employees, lots of money for various contractors, consultants and coaches, and an obscene amount of money for various software subscriptions. The money then gets corporation taxed. Personally, I don't withdraw very much each year and when I do, I get hit with 37.5% dividend tax and 9% student loan repayments. So this \"top line business revenue\" has very little association with the numbers on my personal bank account, in case you're trying to estimate my personal net worth from this video. Maybe I'll talk about that some other time, but yeah - please don't rush to any conclusions from this video on that front :) \n\n⌚️ TIMESTAMPS\n00:00 Intro\n06:29 Junior Doctor Salary\n11:15 Adsense\n25:06 Affiliates\n28:28 Sponsorships\n33:33 Courses\n40:20 PTYA\n\n🔗 LINKS MENTIONED\nHow Skillshare royalty payments work - https://help.skillshare.com/hc/en-us/articles/205222697-Earning-Royalties-",

I've taken great value from some of the principles of Stoicism over the past few years and so I decided to get together with my friend Sam, who is an expert on the ancient Greek philosophy, to put together this class. Over the course of 12 lessons, we explore the key themes of Stoicism as well as explain how to apply Stoic principles to your own life to foster happier and healthier lives as a result. I really hope you enjoy it! \n\nThe Stoic Teacher YT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsMBL2eNuEiZDaqcwD915fw\nFollow Sam on IG: https://www.instagram.com/thestoicteacher/?hl=en\n\nTimestamps:\n00:00 Introduction\n00:45 \"Happiness begins with a clear principle, some things are within are control, some things are not\"\n04:00 \"It is not events that concern people, it is their judgements concerning them\"\n08:08 \"We suffer more in our imagination than in reality\"\n11:50 \"If you would not have a man flinch when the crisis comes, train him before it comes\"\n14:25 \"When you are alone, you should call this tranquility and freedom and when you are with many you shouldn't call a crowd, or trouble or uneasiness but festival and company and contentedly accept it\".\n\nMY FREE ONLINE COURSES:\n🚀  Productivity Masterclass - Principles and Tools to Boost Your Productivity - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/productivity\n🎬  Video Editing with Final Cut Pro X - From Beginner to YouTuber - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/video-editing\n🎓  How to Study for Exams - An Evidence-Based Masterclass - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/studying\n😃  How to be Happier - Stoicism Masterclass - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/stoicism\n\nMY FAVOURITE GEAR:\n🎥  My YouTube Camera Gear - https://kit.co/AliAbdaal\n⌨️  My Keyboard - Wireless Coral mechanical keyboard (Cherry Blue) - https://go.aliabdaal.com/keyboard \n📝  My favourite iPad Screen Protector - Paperlike - https://go.aliabdaal.com/paperlike \n🎒 My Desk Accessories + Todo List - Ugmonk - https://go.aliabdaal.com/ugmonk\n\nMY FAVOURITE SOFTWARE:\n📚  How I remember what I read (Readwise) - https://go.aliabdaal.com/readwise \n🎵  Where I get my Music (amazing for YouTubers) - https://go.aliabdaal.com/epidemicsound\n👻 Where I get my Website Themes from - https://go.aliabdaal.com/ghost-themes\n👻 My personal Ghost Website Theme - https://go.aliabdaal.com/ghost-theme-ali\nWhat I Use For Analytics - https://go.aliabdaal.com/tubebuddy\n🌐  My website platform (Ghost) - https://go.aliabdaal.com/ghost\n🎤  My podcast hosting platform (Transistor) - https://go.aliabdaal.com/transistor\n\nOTHER RECOMMENDED COURSES\n📔 Effortless Output with Roam Research - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/roam\n📓 Building a Second Brain - https://go.aliabdaal.com/course/basb\n\n🎙 MY WEEKLY PODCAST - https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdXpN-Z7LyTgc3OLo_Zw2Pg\nMy brother and I host a weekly podcast where we discuss happiness, creativity and the human condition.

    "title": "We Just Can’t Wait to Begin - The Prion King | Addenbrooke’s Hospital Pantomime 2018",
    "description": "THE ADDENBROOKE’S PANTOMIME\n\nEach year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. \n\nIt follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. \n\nEach year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!\n\nSONG #2 - WE JUST CAN’T WAIT TO BEGIN\n\nThe second song introduces our main cast of ‘good guys’ - Simbastatin, Naloxone, Cornelius, Shelly and Minnie, as well as a load of other students all placed on the same ward in the hospital. The students are filled with naive joy about what life in clinical school is like, and expect they’ll be saving lives as an integral part of the clinical team on a daily basis. This song is a culmination of their continued optimism.\n\nOTHER SONGS:\n\n1. Another day of fun (La La Land) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-QC4mT8bXA\n2. We just can’t wait to begin (The Lion King) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBANvzdbY_s\n\nLYRICS:\n\n[NALA] Clinical school’s finally here,\nThe day we’ve waited for \n[SIMBA] It’s gonna rule that much is clear\nPreclin was such a bore\n\n[SIMBA] I bet this is a piece of cake, \nThe wards sound like a laugh,\n[RAFIKI] Just wait until you’re an F1\nWe’re always understaffed\n\n[ALL] Lectures prepared us for anything\nOh we just can’t wait to begin!\n\n[MINNIE] Ordering blood tests\n([SHELLY] what was that dear?)\n[NALA] Analysing CTs\n([SIMBA] what are they?)\n[CORNELIUS] chatting up patients\n([ZAZUSAN] excuse me?)\n[S, N, M, C, Sh] It’ll be a bre--eze\n([ZAZU] now see here!)\n\n[S, N, M, C, Sh] Always finish by midday\n([ZAZU] A patient a day keeps failure--(interrupted))\n[S, N, M, C, Sh] We’ll have so much time to play\n\n[CORNELIUS] (arm over Nala) I wonder if on my first day I’ll break a patient’s heart\n[NALA] First you’d need a bath and sort that smell out for a start\n\n[DOCTOR] (surrounded by ridiculous number of students) If this is where our hospital \nIs headed, count me out!\nI hate students\nAnd Savannahbrooke’s \nThere’s private work about!!\n\n[ZAZU] (flaps after her) We’re sending half the students to King’s Lynn!\n[ALL] Oh we just can’t wait to begin!\n\n[Sh+C] Learning on the ward rounds\n[MINNIE] Helping run the clinics\n[SIMBA] Acting in the theatres (everyone stares at him)\n[NALA] Simba you are so thick (friendly)\n\n[ALL] We’re finally meeting patients what a dream\nConsultants will all want us on their team\nWe’re gonna save so many lives, you’ll see\nOh we just can’t wait to begin!\nOh we just can’t wait to begin!\nOh we just can’t wait to begin!\n\nCREDITS:\n\nArranged and conducted by Benedict Morris.\nLyrics by Alex Butcher and Sushmita Ramanujam.\nChoreography by Olivia Sharpe.",

Any tips on *learning* stuff initially? \n06:57 - Exams are a month away. Any last minute tips, what you’d be doing?\n10:55 - Any tips on how to learn content quickly? Exams are a month away and we haven’t even finished some of our courses yet. \n11:29 - How do your techniques change 1 month 2 weeks 1 week before the exam?\n12:46 - With active recall, do you make the questions as you read the book? Or do you make notes from the textbook first, and then read them, and then quiz yourself? How do you do it?\n14:21 - How should I use active recall? Do past papers count. \n14:46 - If you have Anki why do you still use your spreadsheet method? Surely you can do all that stuff on Anki with custom decks and filters and stuff. How do you decide what goes on Anki and what goes on Google Sheets?\n\n## Subject Specific\n18:37 - How do you apply flashcards/Anki for essay based subjects like History and English Lit?

    "title": "Another Day of Fun (La La Land) - The Prion King | Addenbrooke’s Hospital Pantomime 2018",
    "description": "THE ADDENBROOKE’S PANTOMIME\n\nEach year, clinical medical students (Years 4-6) at Cambridge University put on a pantomime to raise money for charity. In 2018, we performed “The Prion King” and raised over £10,000 for the Addenbrooke’s Charitable Trust and Medicins Sans Frontieres. \n\nIt follows the story of Simbastatin (a 4th year medical student) and his friends as they navigate their first experiences of life on the wards. The evil villain Scarcoma (a paediatric surgeon-turned forensic pathologist) and his team of feral politicians plot to overthrow the dean of the Cambridge clinical school by unleashing the deadly Prion Disease. \n\nEach year, panto is written, directed, arranged, choreographed and performed by medical students. It’s always an incredible experience for those of us involved in it, and a great way of making friends across year groups. This year, for the first time, we’re putting the musical performances up on YouTube - enjoy!\n\nSONG #1 - ANOTHER DAY OF FUN\n\nThe opening number shows the new 4th year clinical students arriving in Savannahbrooke’s Hospital and trying to navigate their new environment. They’ve spent the past 3 years of preclinical medicine practically living in the library, but are about to meet real patients for the first time. Filled with blind optimism, they burst into La La Land-inspired song. It’s another day of fun.\n\nLYRICS:\n(Explanations in footnotes)\n\nWe’re back for our first day\nWe’re going to start clinical school\nPatients better pray\nWe are so excited, but we still don’t have a clue\nNo one has told us what to do\nWe wish we knew [1]\n\nSummer’s at an end\nThese CPC’s [2] are going to \nDrive me around the bend,\nAnd my placement plan [3]\nJust seems so random and bizarre, \nI think I’m gonna need a car\nKing’s Lynn [4] is way too far!\n\nHope my GP’s somewhere near [5]\nIs he even in our year?\nNot sure what I’m doing here\nWe’ll have to see\n\nWhat the hell’s the GMC? [6]\nAre they friend or foe to me?\nWhere do I find my ward? \nDo I have to go in?!\n\nIn hospital\nAlways have to run\nSo we find everyone with signs [7]                                                                                                            \nWhy’d I live in town? [8]\n(It’s another day of fun)\nI’m always late and now\n(It’s another day of fun)\nThis lanyard’s going brown\nAnd it’s another day of fun!\n\nClimb Hills Road\nWe reach Savannahbrooke’s [9]\nWe’ll find everyone with signs\nBut can it fit us all? [10]\n(It’s another day of fun)\nDo-we have to do on calls?\n(It’s another day of fun)\nCan we still drink at all?\nOh it’s another day of fun!\n\nLYRICS EXPLANATIONS:\n\n[1] General comment about how clinical school (Years 4-6) is a totally different experience to undergrad (Years 1-3) and so everyone’s unsure as to what’s going on\n[2] CPC = Clinical Pathological Conference. Most of our 2-hour clinical pathology lectures take this format, with a panel of experts from various specialities related to the topic (eg: radiology, histopathology, respiratory etc)\n[3] Reference to ‘placements’ where we get sent off for 6 weeks at a time to various hospitals around the East Anglia region.\n[4] Kings Lynn is famously the furthest away (1h30m drive from Cambridge), and so it’s fashionable to complain about it.\n[5] We also get sent off on GP placements, some of which can be up to 2h30m drive away from Cambridge. If you’re unlucky and get put somewhere far away and don’t have a car, you might have to travel for up to 4 hours on public transport to get there…\n[6] GMC = General Medical Council. \n[7] “Signs” refers to physical attributes that some patients might have when you examine them. For example, a “distended abdomen” is a \n[8] Addenbrooke’s hospital is around 2 miles from Cambridge town centre. Students living in town (as opposed to further out) have a ~20 minute cycle to get there each morning.\n[9] “Savannahbrooke’s” is where our pantomime is set. It’s a magical world where all the doctors and patients are animas, hence all the face paint. \n[10] One of the running gags in this year’s pantomime was the increased intake of clinical students, prompting jokes about capacity issues.\n\nCREDITS:\n\nArranged and conducted by Benedict Morris.\nLyrics by Alex Butcher and Sushmita Ramanujam.\nChoreography by Rebecca Green.",

Charlie (4 August 2016 – 28 July 2017) was born with a rare, incurable and life-limiting disease called MDDS. His case became controversial because the medical team and parents disagreed about whether experimental treatment was in Charlie's best interests. \n\nAbi and I are 6th year medical students at Cambridge University, and in this video we've tried to introduce you to some of the issues that Charlie's case brought up. We've made every effort to check our facts, and have referenced a number of useful resources (that we ourselves used) below.

    "description": "📚 Pre-order my book to get an exclusive ticket to The Feel-Good Productivity Annual Planning Workshop!\nWebsite: https://www.feelgoodproductivity.com/?utm_campaign=bonus&utm_source=youtube_long&utm_medium=video_description&utm_content=bulkvidsbefore2021\nAmazon: https://go.feelgoodproductivity.com/bulkvidsbefore2021\nInterview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. \n\nContent Note - Candid discussions about suicide and euthanasia.\n\nIn this video, we take a look at the ethics and law behind family- and physician-assisted suicide. We start with a discussion about family-assisted suicide, and introduce 3 well-known cases that helped shape or illustrate the UK's law around it. We then discuss Lord Falconer's (failed) Assisted Dying bill briefly, before turning to a discussion of the arguments for/against legalising physician-assisted suicide (euthanasia). \n\nAs I mention in the 'future' segment around 00:48, the stuff about family-assisted suicide, and the cases of Diane Pretty, Debbie Purdy and Daniel James, are probably well outside the scope of what you 'need to know' for medicine interviews. If you're just here for some focused medicine interview prep (and there's nothing wrong with that), you'll get the most value from the final 10 minutes of the video starting at 16:50. But if you're interested in the topic generally, then hopefully you'll find the entirety of the video enlightening.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n16:50 - The ethics of euthanasia / assisted suicide - This is the most important and relevant bit for medicine interviews. The rest is for general interest mostly, and probably not directly helpful for interviews.\n\n00:53 - How to watch this video efficiently\n02:32 - Content note about this video\n03:49 - Family Assisted Suicide - an introduction\n05:34 - Case 1: Diane Pretty\n07:33 - Case 2: Debbie Purdy\n12:37 - Case 3: Daniel James\n13:49 - Physician Assisted Suicide - An introduction\n15:10 - Lord Falconer's Assisted Dying Bill 2014\n16:50 - The ethics of euthanasia / assisted suicide\n25:05 - Closing remarks\n\n6med:\n\n6med is a company that my friends and I have been running since 2013. We've taught courses on interviews, BMAT and UKCAT to ~5,000 students with glowing reviews. As we graduate from medical school and become real doctors, we didn't want our course material to go to waste, so we're making YouTube videos on everything we know and releasing them over time.\n\nIf you'd like to check out the courses, or our online BMAT/UKCAT question banks, check out https://6med.co.uk.\nInterview Crash Course Online - https://courses.aliabdaal.com/interview-crash-course-online. \n6med Interview Crash Course - https://6med.co.uk/interview-crash-course\n6med MMI Crash Course - https://6med.co.uk/mmi-crash-course\n\nWho am I:\n\nI'm Ali, a junior doctor working in Cambridge, UK.

To summarise - euthanasia is illegal in the UK. 'Passive euthanasia' is a confusing term which we should avoid. 'Withdrawing medical treatment' is good medical practice when done appropriately, and is NOT the same thing as 'euthanasia'. \n\nThroughout the video we talk through the case of Dr Cox and Lillian Boyes which illustrates a lot of these points and is pretty seminal as far as legal cases go.\n\nCORRECTIONS:\n\nIn Re T (Jehovah’s witness case) it was the refusal that was deemed invalid, not the original consent (Molly said that the consent was found invalid). \n\nAnd in the case of Nigel Cox, he was found guilty of attempted murder, not of manslaughter as we say (at 12.48). \n\nProfound apologies for the inaccuracies, and many thanks to Dr Fistein from the Cambridge Clinical School faculty for pointing out the errors.\n\nTIMESTAMPS:\n\n01:04 - Introducing the Dr Cox + Lillian Boyes case\n02:27 - More information about the case\n04:31 - Active Euthanasia vs Passive Euthanasia\n05:49 - Physician Assisted Suicide\n06:43 - Don't use the phrase 'passive euthanasia'\n08:36 - Doctrine of Double Effect \n12:25 - Dr Cox - The verdict\n14:03 - Ali's closing remarks\n15:55 - Possible MMI scenario\n17:00 - Sneak preview of the next video\n\n6med:\n\n6med is a company that my friends and I have been running since 2013.

We then expand on those a bit, giving you some tidbits that you can throw into your medical ethics answers to get brownie points with your interviewers.

The team tried resuscitation, but were sadly unsuccessful. \n\nMost of my videos about 'life as a medical student' paint quite a positive, almost airbrushed picture of what it's like.\n\nHowever, given the number of medicine applicants who seem to be watching these videos, it seems unfair to only offer the rose-tinted view. \n\nAs such, I won't be shying away from the heavier issues like death and dying that we, as medical professionals, are immensely privileged to be a part of. I hope to be able to talk about them in a sensitive manner, and hope that you'll see these segments in an educational and reflective light.\n\nCLOSING THOUGHTS - \n\nBeing part of the team that evening was a privilege that I'll never forget.\n\nOur patient got the best possible care, but sadly, wasn't able to be resuscitated.\n\nDeath is an unavoidable part of being a doctor (and indeed, of being human). But too often, we're afraid of it, reluctant to talk about it with patients and families. \n\nI'm sure, over the course of my career, I'll meet many more patients who will die. I hope to learn from each, and to share some of that experience with you. \n\nMy thoughts and prayers are with our patient and her family. May she rest in peace.\n\n--------------------\n\nWho am I:\n\nI'm Ali, a junior doctor working in Cambridge, UK. I make videos about medicine, technology, productivity and lifestyle design.
