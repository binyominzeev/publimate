Jason won the CrossFit Games in 2008, and he also runs a successful gym business with six different locations. At the same time, he manages to be an attentive father and husband.\n\nIn this video, I'll share Jason's \"AMRAP Mentality\" - based off of the \"as many reps as possible\" workouts that are practiced so often in CrossFit and many other athletic disciplines. \n\nIn addition to being helpful in the gym and on the field, this mental state will also help you focus more effectively and become more productive in every area of your life.\n\nGet my book \"10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades\" FREE: \nhttps://collegeinfogeek.com/get-better-grades/\n\nFollow Me:\nInstagram ➔ https://instagram.com/tomfrankly\nTwitter ➔ https://twitter.com/tomfrankly\nPodcast ➔ https://www.youtube.com/TheCollegeInfoGeekPodcast\n\nSubscribe to My Channel:\nhttp://buff.ly/1vQP5ar\n\nRead the companion article: \nhttps://collegeinfogeek.com/amrap-mentality/\n\nLinks from the Video:\n\nJason's interview on the Tim Ferriss Show: https://tim.blog/2017/06/14/jason-khalipa/\n\nFollow Jason: https://www.instagram.com/jasonkhalipa/",

    "description": "The best students know that staying in control of their schedule is one of the best ways to earn great grades. Dropping classes is one effective way of retaining that control.\n\n-----\n\nNote: Here's something to consider that I wasn't aware of before. A reader named Paul commented on the blog post:\n\n\"For students who receive financial aid, dropping classes can negatively impact the aid they receive. There’s something called a pass percentage. And unfortunately, many colleges count all the courses you initially start. If you drop too many courses (even for medical withdrawals), you can be put on academic probation. Sometimes you have to appeal to even continue getting aid. While many students could argue they were being smart and strategic about time and schedule as you suggest here, it’s an unnecessary burden for some students to go through.\n\nNow, if someone just drops one or two courses – this financial aid rule won’t be triggered. But, if they have failed a few courses and then dropped some – they could be hit with insufficient academic progress. For the student who does well academically and just decides to drop one or two courses over his/her college career, this won’t matter. But, for some students, this will.\"\n\nIf you've got financial aid that depends on a pass percentage, make sure you're aware of it - and where you stand - before dropping a class!\n\n-----\n\nMy book \"10 Steps to Earning Awesome Grades\" is now out and it's free!
